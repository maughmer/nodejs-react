# NodeJS React

This project was created as part of Maximilian's Schwarzmuller's NodeJS - The Complete Guide course.
This specific project follows the NodeJS Complete Guide project currently in this repo, and uses
Node and React, separating out the UI elements from the Complete Guide into a React front end,
and makes use of REST APIs, JWT, async-await, and websockets to emit updates to other instances
of the app.
